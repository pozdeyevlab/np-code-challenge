# Pozdeyev Lab Code Challenge, Anschutz Medical 
Hello, thank you for taking interest in our lab! We hope you enjoy your code challenge. 

# Instructions
1) Complete the task described to you in the instructions email from Samantha White (samantha.l.white@cuasnchutz.edu)
2) Once you have completed the analysis push your code and any small figures to your branch. (If any files are too large to uplpad please email them directly to Samantha)
3) Code should be reproducible, so please keep that in mind. While your test data may only be a few files we typically deal with hundreds of input files. So, any techniques which could be viably scaled to accommodate this will be appreciated. 

Happy Coding!
